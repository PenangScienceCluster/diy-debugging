# diy-debugging

The goal of this project is to come up with an easy to use key to debug common computer issues. Each question will branch into a second question that will hopefully lead to the desired solution.

Inspired by dichotomous keys used for species identification in plant biology.

A future goal will be an additional interactive polyclave key that would make it even easier for everyone to potentially identify and troubleshoot their computing problems.
